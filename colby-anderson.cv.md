# About Me
I am obsessed with abstractions and certainty. Naturally, this leads me to love pure mathematics and formal logic. And because of my strong background in various areas of computer science (cryptography and systems/software architecture in particular), I've landed in the field of programming language theory, more specifically "applied type theory".


# Education

- BA | Computer Science | Brown University | 2019 - 2024 (gap year included)
- MS | Computer Science | Brown University | 2025 - 2027


# Industry Experience

## Professional Break: Pure Mathematics

*more than Full-Time! | 2024 - 2025 | 9 months*

- Watched multiple full lecture courses (per subject), read associated textbooks, annoyingly taught my wife math, and fell asleep reading wikipedia pages, until I felt comfortable with all of the following subjects: commutative algebra, topology, non-euclidean geometries, measure theory, elementary number theory, algebraic number theory, algebraic topology, knot theory, category theory, proof theory, reverse mathematics, model theory, set theory, type theories, homotopy type theory, and modal logics
- While I am familiar with most concepts and major theorems from all of the above, of course some I spent much more time on than others

## Product Manager at Subspace Labs

*Full-Time | 2023 - 2024 | 13 months*

- I designed, spec'ed, and managed the development of 5 POCs, along with 2 MVPs.
- Designed an access layer for a blockchain-based file storage system, achieving enhanced performance and strengthened privacy through tailored protocols.
- Designed a new identity scheme, leveraging proof-of-personhood, augmented TLS sessions with MPC and ZKP, and blockchain-based verified credentials.
- Formalized security properties for the variations of proof-of-personhood.

## Lead Architect at Hence Labs

*Full-Time | 2022 | 6 months*

- I collaboratively designed the architecture of an entire multi-chain network, produced over 100 pages of specs, and managed the development from concept to MVP.
- Meticulosuly spec'ed novel leader and leaderless consensus algorithms, hot and cold state management, message-passing, and much moreâ€”all with cutting edge industry standards.
- Collaborated on the design of the network topology, committee selection algorithm, and consensus protocols.
- Served as the face and voice of an 8 minute professionally produced marketing video.

## Technical Consultant at Hence Labs

*Part-Time | 2022 | 3 months*

- Informed the design of a multi-chain network and was promoted to a lead architect role.
- Contrasted the network economics, mechanism design, and execution environments of every major blockchain.

## Product Owner at MakerDAO

*Full-Time | 2021 - 2023 | 14 months *

- Built and relased version 1 of an e-learning platform; it was then shortly acquired and repurposed by the operations-focused company Powerhouse.
- Development was always ahead of schedule, due to my ability to limit 'deleted features', refactors, and other technical debt.

## Technical Consultant at MakerDAO

*Part-Time | 2021 | 3 months*

- Designed, developed, and benchmarked an on-chain POC for range polling that mitigated tactical voting.
- Researched and benchmarked the various range polling protocols and defined various attacks against each one.

## Research
I am currently considering a few projects in the realm of proof assistants, program analysis, and type theory...with the expectation that the chosen one will be submitted to a conference by the end of the spring semester 2026.
